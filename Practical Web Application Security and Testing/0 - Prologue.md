## Course Resources  

Welcome to **Practical Webapp Security and Testing (PWST)**! I hope the course is exciting and enlightening for you!  

To get started, you'll need a few things:  

### Course Materials

As we'll cover in the lab setup, there are a few materials you need to be successful.

1.  A hypervisor for running virtual machines. We demo setting up [Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/) on Windows, and [VirtualBox](https://virtualbox.org/) elsewhere.
2.  A text editor. During the setup, we'll install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but some demos are also in Vim.
3.  The [course code repository](https://github.com/mttaggart/pwst-resources). This should be downloaded on both virtual machines we set up in the next unit.
