**Scope** is the explicit set of assets, activities, and objectives that are considered within the bounds of the engagement. Scope defines what is OK and what is not. Scope, broadly speaking, allows us to do what we do. Without scope and the written authorization that confirms it, we are actual, literal criminals.

A well-scoped engagement produces a few artifacts. These can vary between red teams, but generally, all have something like the following:

-   Rules of Engagement, which documents types of activities that are allowed and prohibited
-   IP addresses, DNS records, and other assets that are permitted for testing
-   The engagement timeframe with key dates for deliverables
-   Permitted methodologies and tools
-   The frameworks used to assess the results of an engagement

If you, for even a second, think you can get away with being a so-called “grey hat” in this field, where you use your technical skills to red team legally by day and perform questionable activities by night, **STOP STOP STOP.** You will be caught, you will go to jail, and no one will feel bad for you.

This entire profession is built on trust. You must carry that trust with you at all times. You must do the right thing in a legal sense at all times. You must stop and report immediately if you think you’re about to do something that may be breaking a law.

there are three contrasting ethical frameworks, broadly speaking, that I think contribute to the conversation of ethical red teaming: **Consequentialism, Deontology,** and the **Ethics of Care.** Let’s discuss each in the context of red teaming.

We owe four things to our fellow humans under the Ethics of Care as defined by Joan Tronto:

-   **Attentiveness**, the recognition of others’ needs.
-   **Responsibility,** the choice and motivation to take it upon ourselves to care.
-   **Competency,** the adequate performance of activities in response to care.
-   **Responsiveness,** the alert state of understanding how care has been received.

This type of thinking is not only unprofessional, but it is also **dangerous**. It flies in the face of the actual end-state goal of red teaming, which is to improve the company’s defenders, infrastructure, and procedures through emulated adversarial activity.
